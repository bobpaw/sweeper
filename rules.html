    <!--Minesweeper? Hardly know 'er!-->
    <p>
      Here is an imaginary game to help teach you:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li style="list-style-type:none">
        <div id="example-1_1" class="example"></div>
      </li>
      <li>Starting out, you decide to reveal the center cell.</li>
      <li style="list-style-type:none">
        <div id="example-1_2" class="example"></div>
      </li>
      <li>In the above 3x3 grid, the number 3 represents the number of mines around it.</li>
      <li>Exactly 3 of the other cells must have mines. However, you don't necessarily know <span style="font-style:italic">which</span> cells contain mines.</li>
      <li>You decide to guess and click the top left cell.</li>
      <li style="list-style-type:none">
        <div id="example-1_3" class="example"></div>
      </li>
      <li><span class="thick">Because it has no surrounding mines, it automatically reveals the surrounding cells.</span></li>
      <li>Looking at the one, you can't immediately tell which adjacent cell has a mine. But wait! The 2 <span class="thick">only has 2 adjacent cells</span>! You flag both.</li>
      <li style="list-style-type:none">
        <div id="example-1_4" class="example"></div>
      </li>
      <li>Now you may feel really stuck. However, because the 1 has two adjacent cells, you can think slightly quantum. (Though really it's more statistics.) Look at it as though the 1 is in both. This is really thinking about both possiblities as equally true.</li>
      <li style="list-style-type:none">
        <div id="example-1_5" class="example"></div>
      </li>
      <li>In both scenarios, the 3 is now fulfilled. This leaves the bottom right cell, which must not be a mine!</li>
      <li style="list-style-type:none">
        <div id="example-1_6" class="example"></div>
      </li>
      <li>The 1 is already fulfilled by the flag above it, so the last mine must be in the bottom left.</li>
      <li>Now, you have two choices. <span class="thick">The game is ended by clicking all non-mine cells</span>. Flagging is for your own benefit. You may either click every non-mine cell, or flag everything and then do that to win.</li>
      <li style="list-style-type:none">
        <div id="example-1_7" class="example"></div>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><a href="http://www.minesweeper.info/wiki/3BV">3BV</a> is used to calculate <span class="thick">objective</span> board score or the minimum number of clicks needed to win.
